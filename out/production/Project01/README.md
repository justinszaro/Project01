# Project01
First Sprint

Sprint Goal: To reverse engineer the code base and understand how the game Warring Nations is played. Draw a UML diagram (using LucidChart) of the project. Make sure the UML diagram is labled with the team name and members. You are to have one team member fork this repository and then invite all other team members, and Dr. Schaper, to be collaborators. My email is schaperg@moravian.edu. Add a new player type called Healer. Each team member is to create their own nation with 3 tribes containing 3 members (one of each player type). 

Each team member should know how the game is played to the point that the team could play the game by hand. Index cards would be used for each player labeled with approriate information about the player. Use a random number generator to govern encounters (easy to build one using a spreadsheet). At the end of the sprint the client will want to see the game played by hand to gain confidence that the teams understand the software.


Sprint Due: Tuesday, March 9, 11:59
